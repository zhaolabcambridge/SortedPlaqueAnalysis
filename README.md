## Abstract:
**Objective:**  
A comprehensive understanding of the immune microenvironment in human atherosclerotic plaques is crucial to understanding disease biology and identifying therapeutic targets. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have started to provide detailed transcriptomic signatures of human plaques at single-cell resolution. However, the majority of studies have used a droplet-based scRNA-seq technology paired with upstream fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for clean-up. The effect of FACS on the scRNA-seq workflow remains unknown. Therefore, we sought to investigate this by using a plate-based scRNA-seq technology, which does not require FACS, and compared FACS-treated and bead-enriched plaques in parallel.

**Approach and Results:**  
Human carotid atherosclerotic plaques were taken during endarterectomy surgery and enzymatically digested into a single-cell suspension. This was then split, with half undergoing FACS for viability (7-AAD) and CD45+ cell sorting, and half undergoing CD45+ bead enrichment. The resulting two processing conditions were fixed and underwent plate-based scRNA-seq library preparation, Illumina sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. A total of 5 human carotid plaques were processed. FACS resulted in a significant depletion of TREM2+ and C1Q+ macrophages, neutrophils, and plasmablasts. FACS-treated plaque myeloid and T cells showed upregulation of inflammatory immune pathways, including increases in interferon-gamma and interferon-alpha signalling. Whilst FACS results in fewer inferred cell-cell ligand-receptor interactions compared to bead selection, it did not alter RNA velocity analysis.

**Conclusion:**  
Using FACS prior to scRNAseq causes bias in cellular composition and alters the transcriptome of human atherosclerotic plaques.
